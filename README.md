if you couldn't tell, you should probably join the discord :)

# PasterX tutorials

Want to learn how to add controller support, update offsets, etc. Well, there are tutorials and videos on the [discord](https://dsc.gg/subzerofn) so make sure to join that if you want to learn stuff about your pastes.

# What this is

This is a fully working and fully updated version of PasterX. So this is a completely working fortnite external. If you want to make your own cheat you can use this code if you want.

# How to update offsets

Updating the offsets is really easy. You can get the latest offsets in our [discord](https://dsc.gg/subzerofn).

Once you have the offsets just replace all of your offsets in the "offsets.h" file with the new ones.

If you cant get it to work you can always dm me on discord @paysonism
